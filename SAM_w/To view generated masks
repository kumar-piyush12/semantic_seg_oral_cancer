The "SAM_collab.ipynb" will not be able to show you the "Original Image", "SAM Predicted Mask" and "Ground Truth Mask" due to exceeded limit of storage (>250mb of .ipynb). 
But, I already downloaded "SAM_COMPLETE.ipynb" file just after completion of results, in this file you can visualise the masks along with original image.
